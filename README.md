# CRM with Django

This is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application built using Django framework. The app provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to :

- Create new customers and store their contact information
- View a list of all customers in the system
- Update the details of existing customers
- Delete customers from the system

The app is designed to be easy to use and customizable, with a simple interface and clean code structure. It uses Django's built-in authentication system to allow users to log in and manage customer data securely.
